# About Me  
## My Interests  
In my free time, I mostly enjoy playing video games. My favorites include _Splatoon_, _Valorant_, _Pokemon_, and _Minecraft_. I generally prefer to play games with other people over playing alone. I also enjoy spending time with my family.

## Websites I Recommend
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - I spend a lot of time on YouTube, for both entertainment and education reasons. I find the diverse content very interesting.
* [Showdown!](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com) - As previously mentioned, _Pokemon_ is one of my favorite games. This website is very unique and allows me to battle players from around the world in _Pokemon_.
